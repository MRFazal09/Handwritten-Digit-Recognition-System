# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-System
Handwritten Digit Recognition System using CNN

Project Overview:
This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify digits (0-9) from the famous MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, and the goal is to develop a deep learning model that can recognize these digits with high accuracy.

By training a CNN on this dataset, the system can identify digits from any given image, making it useful for various applications like digit classification in handwritten documents, postal codes, and even digital recognition on devices.

Features:
Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for digit recognition.
Implements Keras with TensorFlow backend for building and training the model.
Includes training and evaluation scripts with data preprocessing and augmentation.
Achieves high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Outputs the results with accuracy plots and classification reports.
Demonstration of live predictions on new handwritten digit inputs.
Steps to Implement this Code:
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Key dependencies:

numpy
matplotlib
keras
tensorflow
Step 3: Run the Training Script
You can train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset using the train_model.py script. The dataset is automatically downloaded if not already available.

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Step 4: Model Evaluation
After training, the script will display the model's accuracy and loss over the epochs, and output a classification report and accuracy plot.

Step 5: Predict New Handwritten Digits
You can run predict_digit.py to test the model with new images of handwritten digits. Simply provide the image path, and the model will output the predicted digit.

bash
Copy code
python predict_digit.py --image path_to_image
Output Video:
A demonstration video showcasing the system's ability to recognize handwritten digits is included. It shows how to input an image of a handwritten digit and get the predicted output in real time.
